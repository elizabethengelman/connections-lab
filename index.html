        Documenting the process of creating, including the challenges, questions
        and ideas that came from that process was one of my favorite things
        about the summer session. Discovering that the process can be the work
        itself felt familiar to me, as I love to capture the small, intricate
        pieces in life. Yet structuring this process of capture in a blog form
        felt new and novel. I am excited about the end result from that time,
        and am excited to continue to add to this collection. The following
        includes a recap blog post for each week of the summer session, each
        including the links to all of the documentation I generated during that
        week.
